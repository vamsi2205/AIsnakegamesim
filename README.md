# AIsnakegamesim
 Building and Training an AI model to create an unbeatable AI snake bot
 
# Snake AI
Summary 
Exploration: The agent takes random actions with decreasing probability as more games are played. 
Exploitation: The agent takes the best-known action based on its current knowledge (Q-values predicted by the neural network). This balance helps the agent learn effectively by initially exploring the environment and later exploiting its knowledge to maximize rewards.

# Python setup
pip install pygame <br>
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio <br>
#pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu <br>
pip install matplotlib ipython <br>
Run with agent.py. <br>
To train, uncomment train() from agent.py. <br>
